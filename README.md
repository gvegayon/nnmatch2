# nnmatch2: Nearest Neighbor Matching 2

This new implementation of `nnmatch` for Stata is faster than the current `nnmatch` available on SSC.
The module is still on development.

For more projects like this please take a look at http://www.its.caltech.edu/~gvegayon

## Install

The ado file hasn't been prepared yet, but you can try it by downloading the file `nnmatch2.do`,
and executing it on your stat session.
